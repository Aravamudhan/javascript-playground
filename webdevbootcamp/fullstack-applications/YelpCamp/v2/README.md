## YelpCamp version 2.0
* In the v2 of the YelpCamp users can add campgrounds and view them later
* This uses mongodb and mongoose for data persistence.
* Dependencies - express, mongoose, body-parser, properties-reader(to avoid hard coding properties and store them in separate files)
* This has GET and POST operations.
* Compared to v1, the v2 has added data persistence instead of mock data.
